Ever since I discovered [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com) and [LandChad](https://landchad.net), I always wanted to set up my own web page and write stuff about things I want to understand. This is an important practice for self education. In general, I sort of managed to do it. The current site is hosted on a [LightSail](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com) server following the instructions from LandChad, and the content is written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and built by Hugo.

In 2023, I wrote just a little bit more posts than 2022, but I felt it was still not frequent enough. The problem was the combination of finding things that worth writing and finding time to write them. Very often, I spend some decent amount of time on certain things, and I want to write up the whole process. Then I realised that it is either too technical or something people already solved. Eventually, I never really write them up.

I think I want to change that. In the new year, I hope I would just stop worrying about whether certain topics are worth writing or not. Maybe I should just write. Sometimes, write for the sake of writing is still a valid reason, I guess ... Let's see if I manage.

Bye 2023! Hello 2024!
