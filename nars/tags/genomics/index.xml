      <description>When we study the functions of a gene of interest (GOI), it is common to use a combination of loss-of-function and gain-of-function assays in a study. In the era of genomics, we often use RNA-seq experiments to find out the affected genes when the level of the GOI is reduced, e.g. siRNA, shRNA &amp;amp; degron, or elevated e.g. over-expression. If the GOI is a transcription factor (TF), a special type of proteins that can specifically interact with DNA to regulate transcription, the natural question to ask is whether those affected genes are regulated directly by the TF.</description>

      <description>The title for this post is &amp;ldquo;How Difficult Is It To Start Your Single-cell Analysis As A Beginner&amp;rdquo;. However, once I finished writing the post, the majority of the content is actually about &amp;ldquo;Seurat and OSCA Installation On Freshly Installed Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora&amp;rdquo;. Oh well &amp;hellip; If you do not have time, just go to the final Summary section to see the final results.&#xA;Introduction When I started my NGS analysis during my PhD, which was more than 10 years ago, one of the most difficult things was software installation.</description>

      <title>ATAC-seq Peak Calling With MACS2</title>

      <description>Although ATAC-seq has been extensively used in the functional genomics field to study chromatin accessibility, it is still under debate how we should perform peak calling to identify oepn chromatin regions. MACS2 is a very popular peak caller for ChIP-seq, and it has been used for ATAC-seq as well. How should we perform ATAC-seq peak calling using MACS2? That is a recurring question. If you pay attention to the details in those publications that uses ATAC-seq, you might notice that some people uses the --shift -100 --extsize 200 flags during MACS2 peak calling.</description>
