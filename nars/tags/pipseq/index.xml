      <description>In one of the post where we figured out the library structure of the PIPseq$^{\textmd{TM}}$ V3 chemistry last year, we left a cliffhanger about how the PIPseeker$^{\textmd{TM}}$ software from FluentBio performed the barcode &amp;ldquo;translation&amp;rdquo;. During the translation, an original cell barcode that consists of four parts of &amp;ldquo;sub-barcodes&amp;rdquo; (8 bp + 6 bp + 6 bp + 8 bp) got mapped to a 16-bp barcode.&#xA;The V3 data Using the species mixing data from the V3 chemistry mentioned in the previous post, we would end up with the following files in our working directory if we finished all procedures described in the previous post:</description>

      <description>NOTE: this post is just a slightly more detailed version of this Twitter thread.&#xA;Not very long after I wrote the series about guessing the library layout of PIP-seq, the raw data (FASTQ files) for the V4 chemistry were made available from the FluentBio website, which is really nice.&#xA;Now let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at what has been changed. The experimental procedures seem to remain the same. What about the library layout and barcodes?</description>
