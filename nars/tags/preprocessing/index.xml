      <description>The title for this post is &amp;ldquo;How Difficult Is It To Start Your Single-cell Analysis As A Beginner&amp;rdquo;. However, once I finished writing the post, the majority of the content is actually about &amp;ldquo;Seurat and OSCA Installation On Freshly Installed Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora&amp;rdquo;. Oh well &amp;hellip; If you do not have time, just go to the final Summary section to see the final results.&#xA;Introduction When I started my NGS analysis during my PhD, which was more than 10 years ago, one of the most difficult things was software installation.</description>

      <description>Early this week, I was re-organising my bookmarks in the browser and I came across this post by Heng Li published more than 6 years ago. It reminded me one of the problem I faced ~10 years ago when I first started using the GRCh38/hg38 version of the human reference genome for RNA-seq analysis. Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look what the problem was.&#xA;Now if we go to the UCSC genome browser to download the reference genome data, we see that there are a couple of options:</description>

      <description>In recent years, I noticed one problem about the ATAC-seq/scATAC-seq experiments we did in the lab. Specifically, it is related to the ATAC-seq insert size, or fragment length, plotting. The distribution of the fragment length in an ATAC-seq experiment is an important quality control metric. Since the transposase Tn5 can only go to those nucleosome-free regions, the lengths of the fragments after Tn5 transposition often exhibit a nucleosomal ladder pattern, like shown in this post where I described how to draw the plot by looking at the 9th column of the aligned SAM/BAM file.</description>

      <description>When I started my PhD back in 2009, the next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies had already been out there for a while. They were in the process of being adapted by many labs. My impression back then was that it was difficult to learn how exactly those methods worked. There were many reasons for that, and one of them was the need of the commercial kits for the library preparation. As a beginner, you kind of knew roughly what the kit was doing: end repair, A tailing, ligate the adapters to the fragments etc.</description>
