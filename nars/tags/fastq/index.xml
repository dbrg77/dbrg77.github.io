      <description>A few month ago, I ranted about the FastQ files submission for data produced by complex genomic protocols. The main reason of the rant is that we tried to get some single cell data from SRA, and we really needed the cell barcodes for the data preprocessing and analysis. However, the cell barcodes are stored in the indexing reads where it seems impossible to get from the .sra file. Recently, I finally found a way of getting those information &amp;hellip; well &amp;hellip; at least for some studies.</description>

      <description>This post collects my thoughts about fastq files accumlated over the years, specifically focusing on what should be included during a submission. It is not about the format of fastq files. If you are not sure about the format, you can check the Wikipedia page and this excellent paper by Cock et al. that contains very deteiled information and the history about the fastq file.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s first look at what you will get from a typical Illumina sequencing experiment.</description>
