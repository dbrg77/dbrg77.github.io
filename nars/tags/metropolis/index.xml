      <description>Ever since I came across the metropolis theme of Beamer two years ago, I always used that theme to prepare presentation and lecture slides whenever possible. I really like the design. The style is hard to resist. One problem with it or with beamer in general is that plotting is difficult and limited. I know that pgfplots is very powerful, and you can do some pretty complicated plots with it. I used it for routine basic plotting in Beamer, such as the box/scatter plot, the bar chart, the histogram.</description>
