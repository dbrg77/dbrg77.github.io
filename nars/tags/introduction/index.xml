      <description>Ever since I discovered Hugo, GitHub Page and LandChad, I always wanted to set up my own web page and write stuff about things I want to understand. This is an important practice for self education. In general, I sort of managed to do it. The current site is hosted on a LightSail server following the instructions from LandChad, and the content is written in Markdown and built by Hugo.</description>
