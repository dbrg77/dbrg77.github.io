The &lt;strong>probability density function (PDF)&lt;/strong> is&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$f_{\boldsymbol{X}}(x) = \cfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}\,e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the population &lt;strong>mean&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>standard deviation&lt;/strong>, respectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like most people when they first came across this function, the derivation of the function was not really introduced. Soon after that, we started to use it to calculate probabilities and other things. However, where does it come from? What&amp;rsquo;s the intuition of the function? Why are two of the most important constants $\pi$ and $e$ there? Those questions lingered in my brain ever since.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
