The original publication (&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v10/n12/full/nmeth.2688.html">Nature Methods 10, 1213-1218&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>) has been cited 441 times at this moment of writing (1,073 times at this moment of re-posting). It has become almost a routine for a lab that is interested in transcriptional regulation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One common QC for the data is to plot the fragment size density of your libraries. The successful construction of a ATAC library requires a proper pair of Tn5 transposase cutting events at the ends of DNA. In the nucleosome-free open chromatin regions, many molecules of Tn5 can kick in and chop the DNA into small pieces; around nucleosome-occupied regions, Tn5 can only access the linker regions. Therefore, in a normal ATAC-seq library, you should expect to see a sharp peak at the &amp;lt;100 bp region (open chromatin), and a peak at ~200bp region (mono-nucleosome), and other larger peaks (multi-nucleosomes).
