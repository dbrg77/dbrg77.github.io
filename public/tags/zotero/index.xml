      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t really used Windows since 2012 when I switched from Windows 7 to Mac OS. In recent years, I occasionally found myself in a situation where I had to use Windows for certain admin-related stuff. On top of that, I recently came across GOG that prompted me to play some classic PC games from the old days. Therefore, I built a PC and installed Windows 11. The user experience of Windows 11 so far was not really great for me.</description>

      <description>I used to use Paperpile and Google Doc for writing scientific papers and managing the literature PDFs. The process was very smooth. I did not really have the habit of saving PDFs locally, because I did not need to. In 2019, I relocated to my current place, and accessing Google Doc has been a pain ever since. Even if I managed to use Google Doc, the speed was pathetic and the connection was intermittent.</description>
