In the era of genomics, we often use &lt;strong>RNA-seq&lt;/strong> experiments to find out the affected genes when the level of the GOI is reduced, &lt;em>e.g.&lt;/em> siRNA, shRNA &amp;amp; degron, or elevated &lt;em>e.g.&lt;/em> over-expression. If the GOI is a &lt;strong>transcription factor (TF)&lt;/strong>, a special type of proteins that can specifically interact with DNA to regulate transcription, the natural question to ask is whether those affected genes are regulated directly by the TF. When we say &amp;ldquo;directly&amp;rdquo;, we often mean that the TF binds to the &lt;strong>regulatory elements&lt;/strong> of a gene and regulate the transcription of that gene. This is different to the situation where the TF affects the expression of some genes which in turn change the expressions of the genes that we see in the RNA-seq experiments. How do we do that? Again, in the era of genomics, we often use &lt;strong>ChIP-seq&lt;/strong>, which is really good at finding &lt;em>bona fide&lt;/em> genome-wide binding events of a TF in an unbiased manner.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why do I like CUT&amp;RUN more than ChIP-seq</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2018-10-23-why-do-i-like-cut-and-run-more-than-chip-seq/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2018-10-23-why-do-i-like-cut-and-run-more-than-chip-seq/</guid><description>&lt;p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is one of the gold standards to study protein-DNA interaction &lt;em>in vivo&lt;/em>. In 1984, John Lis&amp;rsquo; lab at Cornell invented the first ChIP method using UV to crosslink protein to DNA, and they used this approach to study the interaction of the RNA polymerase with specific genes (&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC345570/">&lt;strong>Gilmour and Lis&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>1984&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>). However, UV crosslinking causes DNA damage that makes cerntain downstream analysis, such as PCR, very difficult. Most people often choose to use another approach developed by Alexander Varshavsky&amp;rsquo;s lab later in 1988 at MIT, where they used formaldehyde for the crosslinking to study the histone-DNA interaction around the &lt;em>hsp70&lt;/em> gene (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867488904692">&lt;strong>Solomon&lt;/strong> &lt;em>&lt;strong>et al.&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>, &lt;strong>1988&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>). Ever since then, the ChIP protocols have been optimised and developed extensively, with a lot of method variations invented along the way.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
