&lt;p>When talking about scATAC-seq data preprocessing, I guess the first method that most people choose is &lt;a href="https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-atac/software/overview/welcome">&lt;strong>Cell Ranger ATAC&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>. The 10x Genomics Single Cell ATAC kit is probably the most widely used commercial method for doing scATAC-seq, and &lt;strong>Cell Ranger ATAC&lt;/strong> provides a very convenient way of converting the raw sequencing reads to some sort of count matrix for downstream in-depth analyses. The problems with &lt;strong>Cell Ranger ATAC&lt;/strong> are that:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PIPseq again - PIPseeker$^{\textmd{TM}}$ Barcode Translation</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2024-06-11-pipseq-again-pipseeker-barcode-translation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 09:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2024-06-11-pipseq-again-pipseeker-barcode-translation/</guid><description>&lt;p>In &lt;a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/2023-06-03-guessing-library-structures-2/">&lt;strong>one of the post&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> where we figured out the library structure of the PIPseq$^{\textmd{TM}}$ V3 chemistry last year, we left a cliffhanger about how the &lt;a href="https://www.fluentbio.com/products/pipseeker-software-for-data-analysis/">PIPseeker$^{\textmd{TM}}$&lt;/a> software from &lt;strong>FluentBio&lt;/strong> performed the barcode &amp;ldquo;translation&amp;rdquo;.

&lt;p>Not very long after I wrote &lt;a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/2023-05-28-guessing-library-structures-1/">the series&lt;/a> about guessing the library layout of PIP-seq, the raw data (FASTQ files) for the V4 chemistry were made available from the &lt;a href="https://www.fluentbio.com/datasets/">FluentBio website&lt;/a>, which is really nice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at what has been changed. The experimental procedures seem to remain the same. What about the library layout and barcodes? Let&amp;rsquo;s use the &lt;strong>T20 Kit V4 Barnyard Study&lt;/strong> data to figure that out. With the experience from the previous versions, we can immediately start with FastQC of Read 1.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Guessing Library Structures (4) - PIP-seq V1prototype</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2023-06-07-guessing-library-structures-4/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jun 2023 00:30:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2023-06-07-guessing-library-structures-4/</guid><description>&lt;div class="admonition note">

&lt;p>In the previous post, we have figured out the library structure of many samples from the &lt;strong>Clark2023&lt;/strong> paper. They are using the commerical &lt;strong>FluentBio&lt;/strong> kits, so they basically have the &lt;a href="https://teichlab.github.io/scg_lib_structs/methods_html/PIP-seq.html">PIPseq$^{\textmd{TM}}$ V3 library structure&lt;/a>.

It means the method was under development way ahead of that date. The final publication in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-01685-z">Nature Biotechnology&lt;/a> (Clark2023) is on 06 March 2023. If we consider the time between the start of the method development and the final publication, it is not surprising to see different versions of the method in the paper. This is indeed the case which we will demonstrate.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Guessing Library Structures (1) - Background</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2023-05-28-guessing-library-structures-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 May 2023 14:46:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2023-05-28-guessing-library-structures-1/</guid><description>&lt;div class="admonition note">

&lt;h2 id="whats-the-problem">What&amp;rsquo;s The Problem?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are many interesting questions we can ask, but to what extent can we investigate and do research on them? This is heavily dependent on the methods we have. We believe methods matter!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Single Cell Data Preprocessing</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2022-09-06-single-cell-data-preprocessing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 22:35:53 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2022-09-06-single-cell-data-preprocessing/</guid><description>&lt;p>When I started my PhD back in 2009, the next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies had already been out there for a while. They were in the process of being adapted by many labs. My impression back then was that it was difficult to learn how exactly those methods worked. There were many reasons for that, and one of them was the need of the commercial kits for the library preparation. As a beginner, you kind of knew roughly what the kit was doing: end repair, A tailing, ligate the adapters to the fragments &lt;em>etc&lt;/em>. However, there were many missing details due to the black box nature of the kit. For example, what enzymes are used in each step? What are the oligo sequences? Are there any modifications on the oligos? Those things are critical to understand the method.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Getting Index Reads From SRA</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2022-07-26-getting-index-reads-from-sra/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2022 10:07:27 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2022-07-26-getting-index-reads-from-sra/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few month ago, I ranted about the &lt;a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/2022-02-27-about-fastq-files-submission/">&lt;strong>FastQ files submission&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> for data produced by complex genomic protocols. The main reason of the rant is that we tried to get some single cell data from &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra">&lt;strong>SRA&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>, and we really needed the cell barcodes for the data preprocessing and analysis. However, the cell barcodes are stored in the indexing reads where it &lt;em>seems&lt;/em> impossible to get from the &lt;code>.sra&lt;/code> file.

It is not about the format of fastq files. If you are not sure about the format, you can check the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format">Wikipedia page&lt;/a> and this excellent paper by &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkp1137">Cock &lt;em>et al.&lt;/em>&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> that contains very deteiled information and the history about the fastq file.&lt;/p>

Ever since then, the field of single cell genomics is rapidly evolving and has proved to be powerful in many aspects of biology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many methods (mainly for scRNA-seq) are invented along the way, which is a good thing. However, I&amp;rsquo;m a bit bombarded and lost in those methods. Many of them are full of technical jargons and it is not straightforward to figure out how they actually work and what the differences are among those methods. To help understand how a method works, people tend to present some schematic views of how the sequencing library is generated using their method. For example, this is a very nice summary of 8 different scRNA-seq methods taken from a recent review by &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/bfg/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bfgp/ely009/4951519">&lt;strong>Ziegenhain&lt;/strong> &lt;em>&lt;strong>et al&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>.&lt;/a>:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
