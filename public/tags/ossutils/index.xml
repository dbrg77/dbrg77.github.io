For some of them, you need to find alternative ways of achieving the same goals. For example, finding a way of visualising &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/help/bigWig.html">bigWig&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> signal files. This is very important for the assessment of the data quality. I hate to say it, but it is often true that the most efficient way of telling whether an experiment works or not is the least scientific way, which is by visual inspection. Looking at bigWig signals is relatively easy in &lt;a href="https://randomstate.net/2018-07-02-setting-up-public-links-for-ucsc-visualisation/">my previous institute&lt;/a>, but it is not so straigtforward for a small lab that does not have good computational support. Things become even more annoying and complicated when your lab is in China mainland for obvious reasons.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
