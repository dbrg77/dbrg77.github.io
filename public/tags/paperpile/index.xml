      <description>I used to use Paperpile and Google Doc for writing scientific papers and managing the literature PDFs. The process was very smooth. I did not really have the habit of saving PDFs locally, because I did not need to. In 2019, I relocated to my current place, and accessing Google Doc has been a pain ever since. Even if I managed to use Google Doc, the speed was pathetic and the connection was intermittent.</description>
