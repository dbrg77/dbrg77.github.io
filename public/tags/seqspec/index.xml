      <description>NOTE: this post is just a slightly more detailed version of this Twitter thread.&#xA;Not very long after I wrote the series about guessing the library layout of PIP-seq, the raw data (FASTQ files) for the V4 chemistry were made available from the FluentBio website, which is really nice.&#xA;Now let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at what has been changed. The experimental procedures seem to remain the same. What about the library layout and barcodes?</description>

There are many interesting questions we can ask, but to what extent can we investigate and do research on them?</description>
