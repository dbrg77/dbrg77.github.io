In recent years, I occasionally found myself in a situation where I had to use Windows for certain admin-related stuff. On top of that, I recently came across &lt;a href="https://www.gog.com/en/">GOG&lt;/a> that prompted me to play some classic PC games from the old days. Therefore, I built a PC and installed Windows 11. The user experience of Windows 11 so far was not really great for me. I&amp;rsquo;m okay with this, because I&amp;rsquo;m still mainly using my Mac computers. Currently, I have an iMac at work, a MacBookPro laptop and a Windows PC at home.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Need To Write More</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2023-12-31-need-to-write-more/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 22:25:53 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2023-12-31-need-to-write-more/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ever since I discovered &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Page&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://landchad.net">LandChad&lt;/a>, I always wanted to set up my own web page and write stuff about things I want to understand. This is an important practice for self education. In general, I sort of managed to do it. The current site is hosted on a &lt;a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com">LightSail&lt;/a> server following the instructions from LandChad, and the content is written in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown&lt;/a> and built by Hugo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2023, I wrote just a little bit more posts than 2022, but I felt it was still not frequent enough. The problem was the combination of finding things that worth writing and finding time to write them. Very often, I spend some decent amount of time on certain things, and I want to write up the whole process. Then I realised that it is either too technical or something people already solved. Eventually, I never really write them up.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using Zotero With iCloud As The Storage</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2022-10-04-using-zotero-with-icloud-as-the-storage/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Oct 2022 15:07:53 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2022-10-04-using-zotero-with-icloud-as-the-storage/</guid><description>&lt;p>I used to use &lt;a href="https://paperpile.com">&lt;strong>Paperpile&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com">&lt;strong>Google Doc&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> for writing scientific papers and managing the literature PDFs. The process was very smooth. I did not really have the habit of saving PDFs locally, because I did not need to. In 2019, I relocated to my current place, and accessing Google Doc has been a pain ever since. Even if I managed to use Google Doc, the speed was pathetic and the connection was intermittent. The internet situation at my current university is pretty bad. To show you an example:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
