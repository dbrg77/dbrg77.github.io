I do not have a professional camera, and I just use my mobile phone. This is just for fun and for the sake of record keeping. The idea I have in mind is to show a 3-by-3 photo grid at the end of the post, because I like a 3-by-3 grid. Everybody likes 3-by-3 grids, right? In Chinese, we call it &amp;ldquo;九宫格&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
