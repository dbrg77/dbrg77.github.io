This is an important practice for self education. In general, I sort of managed to do it. The current site is hosted on a &lt;a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com">LightSail&lt;/a> server following the instructions from LandChad, and the content is written in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown&lt;/a> and built by Hugo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2023, I wrote just a little bit more posts than 2022, but I felt it was still not frequent enough. The problem was the combination of finding things that worth writing and finding time to write them. Very often, I spend some decent amount of time on certain things, and I want to write up the whole process. Then I realised that it is either too technical or something people already solved. Eventually, I never really write them up.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello, Hugo!</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2022-02-24-hello-hugo/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2022 23:39:49 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2022-02-24-hello-hugo/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well, the idea of using &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.markdowntutorial.com/">Markdown&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> to write blog posts is hard to resist, and &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> + &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> are awesome!&lt;/p>
