In recent years, I occasionally found myself in a situation where I had to use Windows for certain admin-related stuff. On top of that, I recently came across &lt;a href="https://www.gog.com/en/">GOG&lt;/a> that prompted me to play some classic PC games from the old days. Therefore, I built a PC and installed Windows 11. The user experience of Windows 11 so far was not really great for me. I&amp;rsquo;m okay with this, because I&amp;rsquo;m still mainly using my Mac computers. Currently, I have an iMac at work, a MacBookPro laptop and a Windows PC at home.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
